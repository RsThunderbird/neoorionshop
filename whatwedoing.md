So im actually going on a vacation and i cant bring my pc with me. So i have to use the time and use one of my parked domains to host a static website that can run the platform. I mentioned education because in my entire life ive always tried to work with people and in the end the proportion is almost always 9:1 or 9.9:0.1 yup, not kidding. That's the work flow i follow but yh i need to shift my focus to businesses that count as solo businesses and sole propreitorships. To me "alot of money" dosent matter, i need money that's "constant" even if its very low. And also the universal thing of this world: LAW. I MUST learn law. Business law, all the law that concerns me as an individual. Face all the dark realities and allat. Yeah those two are my main focus as of now.


At the end of the day this is what we need to do:
Use vercel to make a sleek glass morphed amoled black css design thats fully interactive.
Use 4 api keys: 
I'm gonna list the api keys now:
1) AIzaSyAXUWTQnG9qPS8BnE_QH-NyDCVsfp4DIyA
2) AIzaSyBQb2wKX54JvFrglhanHA-kN0H-pWmh73w
3) AIzaSyBvTBe_9W4EQj9oLPvipDaX7Vee8zHuq3Y
4) AIzaSyApdbhcuew_W6CWXBAFNiEh_8LZ_2zaQMA

We need to make a system in which has a collection of models: (use exact names as i provide, no second thought) gemini-3-flash-preview( main model) make 2 of these and 1 of this: gemini-2.5-flash-lite as a 3rd fallback and for the 4th its actually a image model: gemini-2.5-flash-image.
more api keys can be provided on request.

End goal:
this needs to be hosted on cloudflare pages and we'll use a domain called neoorion.shop and basically use that

So this needs to be a guide for the user "Thunderbird" a personal project.
The ui needs to include a huge screen as well to show all the images. 
So whats with all the image stressing? there needs to be an explicit option for generating images. 

And the 3 keys i provided must not be **processed** or even handshake when a process happens or it'll count as a request and trigger a 429.
Yeah, This ai will guide thunderbird about solo businesses and everything about the law side of this world and business law. 
Also include a side panel on the right side of the screen which is like a processing panel which shows the exact processes happening in the backend, this panel can be opened and closed.

ALso include a fully customizable RGB chroma controlling the accents of the entire website from a single module.
